In the context of a discrete Tetris environment, the phenomenon you described can be explained as follows:

1. Training Phase:
- Masked-Agent: During the training phase, the masked-agent might perform better initially because it has a form of randomness injected into its actions. In the discrete Tetris environment, this randomness could be achieved by randomly choosing to ignore or mask some possible moves, forcing the agent to explore different actions and potentially discover better strategies. This exploration can lead to the agent finding more optimal placements for the tetrominoes and clearing lines more effectively.

- Unmasked-Agent: On the other hand, the unmasked-agent is not subjected to this exploration noise and might struggle to explore the action space efficiently during training. It may not consider certain moves that could lead to better outcomes, and as a result, it might converge to a suboptimal policy during the training phase.

2. Evaluation Phase:
- Masked-Agent: During evaluation, the exploration noise is removed or reduced, and the masked-agent tends to exploit the policy it has learned during training. In the discrete Tetris environment, this means the agent will now make decisions based on its learned strategy without any additional randomness. However, in Tetris, randomness can be beneficial in dealing with the inherent uncertainty in the game, such as the arrival of tetrominoes, so the absence of exploration noise can lead to suboptimal performance during evaluation.

- Unmasked-Agent: The unmasked-agent, which had more time to train without exploration noise, has potentially learned a more accurate representation of the optimal policy for playing Tetris. As a result, it performs better during evaluation compared to the masked-agent, which might have become overly reliant on exploration noise during training.

To address this issue and improve the performance of the agents, various exploration strategies can be used during training. In the context of discrete Tetris, exploration techniques could involve introducing a small probability of randomly choosing actions (e.g., random moves or rotations) even for the unmasked-agent during training. This allows the agent to explore the action space more effectively while still benefiting from the learned policy during evaluation.

Additionally, learning algorithms like Deep Q Networks (DQN) can benefit from fine-tuning the exploration-exploitation trade-off by adjusting parameters like epsilon in an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This way, the agent can strike a better balance between exploring new moves and exploiting its learned policy effectively.

In summary, in a discrete Tetris environment, understanding and managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for training agents that perform well both during training and evaluation. Properly balanced exploration strategies can help the agent discover effective tactics while avoiding overfitting to exploration noise, leading to improved performance in the long run.


Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. I want to clarify that in general, the performance of agents in SAC during evaluation and training is not necessarily guaranteed to be exactly the same. The performance can be similar, but it can still differ due to several factors.

The reason SAC can exhibit similar performance during evaluation and training, compared to DQN, is due to its inherent exploration strategy and algorithm design. SAC utilizes a stochastic policy and incorporates an entropy term in its objective function, encouraging the policy to be inherently exploratory throughout both the training and evaluation phases. This continuous exploration during evaluation allows SAC to maintain similar performance levels in comparison to its training performance.

However, it's essential to note that SAC's performance during evaluation can still be influenced by various factors:

1. Exploration Intensity: Though SAC has a more consistent exploration strategy, the intensity of exploration can still vary during training and evaluation, which may lead to subtle differences in performance.

2. Exploration Decay: Some SAC implementations may have a decay mechanism for the exploration (entropy regularization) during training. If the decay is set to zero during evaluation, it could result in slightly different exploration levels between the two phases.

3. Target Policy Update: SAC employs soft policy updates, but target policy updates are still used to stabilize learning. The lag between the policy updates might contribute to minor discrepancies in performance.

4. Sample Efficiency: If the agent is not trained for sufficient steps, the policy might not have fully converged, leading to some performance differences between training and evaluation.

5. Evaluation Environment: Sometimes, the evaluation environment might have slight differences or noise compared to the training environment, which could influence the agent's performance.

Overall, while SAC's exploration strategy and soft policy updates contribute to its potential for more consistent performance between training and evaluation, it doesn't guarantee identical performance. The degree of similarity in performance depends on several factors, including hyperparameters, environment setup, and the specific SAC implementation. Nonetheless, SAC is generally designed to be more sample-efficient and robust, and it often exhibits relatively stable performance across different stages of learning.
